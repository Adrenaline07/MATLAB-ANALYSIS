# PID-Active_Suspension_System
The primary objective of this project is to observe and analyze the real-time behavior of a single active car wheel suspension. To accomplish this, the system integrates an Arduino microcontroller as its central processing unit, servos as actuators, and additional sensors such as load cells and a motor speed detector. The Arduino microcontroller is programmed to receive input from both the road data and load cells, utilizing this information to output control signals to the motor drivers, wheel speed, and the status of the actuator, particularly the servos. This comprehensive system aims to enhance ride quality and car handling by ensuring consistent tire alignment with the road during cornering, minimizing undesired contacts between the vehicle frame and the ground (especially over depressions), and overall improving traction and steering control.
